\chapter{Providers Description} \label{section:providers}
    The data warehouses are going to contain data from several different providers.
    
    In this section we will describe the different kinds of providers, along with some semantic issues, to give a perspective of both the sheer amount of data required and of its complexity.
    
    A detailed description of the providers cannot be provided, since it can be considered a trade secret.\reword
