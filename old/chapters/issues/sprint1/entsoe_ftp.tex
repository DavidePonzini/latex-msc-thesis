We happened to notice some inconsistencies between the data present in the DWH and the same data in the old DB.

In detail, we had the same information except for the publication time, which differed.
Table \ref{tab:issues:entsoe_web_ftp} shows an example of this problem.

The data in the DWH was downloaded from ENTSOE's FTP service, while the one in the DB was downloaded through a web scraper.

Upon further investigation, we found out that the data in the FTP service is updated daily, while the web pages are updated at real-time.

\todoissues{Completare, riscrivere sopra}Given the high importance of having real-time data, we had to stop the current process and build it again from zero.
