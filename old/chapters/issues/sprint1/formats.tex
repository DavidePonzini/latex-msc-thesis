An unexpected problem arose when downloading old data for some providers.

\reword
EPEX stores data pre-2019 in .gz format, while the rest of the data is stored in .csv format.

This caused some errors in the downloader, since it was expecting .csv files.
As a result of the notification systems in-place, Reply was notified of the issue and worked to implement a procedure to extract the .csv files contained in the archives and then process them accordingly.
