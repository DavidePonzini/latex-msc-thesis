After the deployment of sprint 1 on to the production environment, Microsoft released an update for Azure Databricks.

However, the update made some libraries used incompatible with the \todoissues{incompatible libraries}...

The libraries affected are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Selenium (Web Scraping)
        \item xlpr (Excel)
        \item pysftp (SFTP)
    \end{itemize}

Reply sent a ticket to Microsoft, which proposed three workarounds.
However none of them worked.

These problems were solved by \todoissues{solution}...
