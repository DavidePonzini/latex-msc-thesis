    \section{Provider updates}
        \todoissues{Snam update}    
            snam websites launched a new portal for exposing data and decided not to update the data in the old portal.
            
            this news arrived during development of the etl from the snam website.
            as such it was necessary to stop all dev processes on the provider, while analysing the situation and understanding if it was necessary to start again from scratch on the new portal.
