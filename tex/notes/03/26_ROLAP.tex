\subsection{ROLAP Schema}
    \subsubsection{Description}
        Views are just joins between fact and dimension tables, replacing ids with their textual representations, proving better readability.

    \subsubsection{Dimensions}
        \input{tex/notes/03/26_dimensions.tex}
        
    \subsubsection{Facts}
        \input{tex/notes/03/26_facts.tex}

\subsection{Usage}
    A \textit{Julia} script is run every 30 minutes with some default parameters.
    Additionally, it can be manually launched from an Excel spreadsheet with custom-set parameters.
    
    \paragraph{Output} In case of a scheduled jobs the results are saved to the db, otherwise they are shown on the spreadsheet.
    
    \paragraph{Goal} The goal is to predict market prices for the following day, on different markets.
    
    \subsubsection{Workflow}
    The script executes the following actions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Data acquisition
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Curves
            \item Realized flows
            \item PTDF
            \item Capacities
            \item Block bids
            \item Consumption FCT timeseries
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Consumption computations with ML
        
        \item Market model
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Requires all data previously produced
            \item Produces market prices for the following day
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    The results are either saved to db or shown to the user.
    
    At 12.42 the stock market shows the official prices, which are used as input for the following day.
