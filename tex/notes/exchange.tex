An exchange is an organized market where tradable securities, commodities, foreign exchange, futures, and options contracts are sold and bought. \cite{bib:wikipedia:exchange}

Exchange markets provide information on how much a given commodity (e.g. electricity, gas, etc.) is priced at a given moment, as well as information about demand and supply.
These data are fundamental when trying to predict the prices for the following day, which are used to decide whether to bid on something or not and how much to bid on it.\newline

The following providers are all exchange markets.

APX, EPEX SPOT, GME, OMIE
