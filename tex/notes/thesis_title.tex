\textbf{Reengineering the Analytical Back-end of an Energy Distribution Company}

\texttt{
    The thesis will investigate the re-engineering of the data warehouse and ETL processes of an energy distribution company and their migration from on-premise to cloud solutions.
    Starting with an understanding of the existing data management and analysis solutions involved in the acquisition and management of energy products and an understanding of the rules of operation of the energy domain, a new integrated analytical back-end will be designed.
    The improvement in terms of data quality and analysis efficiency will be analyzed, together with the organizational impact of the new solution.
