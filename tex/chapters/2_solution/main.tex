\part{Proposed Solution}
    \chapter*{Overview}
        Considering all the problems explained previously, Reply proposed a solution for developing the Data Warehouse, as shown in figure \ref{fig:azure:workflow}.
        Their proposal also included a software architecture for performing analyses on the Data Warehouse.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Several scripts, executed by Databricks, download the data using different techniques, such as API calling, FTP downloading or web scraping.
            \item This data is then stored on DataLake, under the \texttt{rawdata} folder.
            \item Those files are recovered by Databricks, which applies some transformations on the data, for example normalization or column removal.
            \item The result is saved again on DataLake, in \textit{csv} format, under the \texttt{srcdata} folder.
            \item The values from the \textit{csv} files are loaded into the data warehouse.
            The communication between the blob storage and the data warehouse is handled by Polybase.
            \item Some values stored in the data warehouse are accessed by Databricks and used as configuration settings.
            \item The data warehouse is queried by reporting tools, such as Excel or PowerBI, as well as algorithms developed by Axpo.
            \item In case of heavy workloads, it is also possible to query a copy of the data warehouse, located on Azure Analytics Services.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        I analyzed their proposal, paying particular attention to the ETL process and Data Warehouse structure, as well as the workflow chosen for developing such structures.
        
        In what follows, it will be discussed:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The workflow used by Reply.
            \item How the ETL process works.
            \item The structure of the Data Warehouse and the reasons for that choice.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Problems and difficulties identified during each part of the process will also be discussed.
        Several examples will also be provided.
