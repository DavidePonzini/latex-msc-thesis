Databricks stores downloaded and transformed files on Data Lake.

Each folder contains a different type of data, in order to avoid confusion.

\paragraph{Rawdata}
    The folder \texttt{rawdata} contains all files downloaded from the web \textit{as-is}.
    
    These files will be read by Databricks, which will perform normalization and cleaning operations on them.

\paragraph{Srcdata}
    Cleaned files are stored under the \texttt{srcdata} folder.
    
    These files will then be inserted into the data warehouse by an apposite procedure in Databricks.\newline
    
This decision to have two different folders helps in avoiding confusion when tracing errors.
