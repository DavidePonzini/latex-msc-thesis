The next step is to take these high-level information and provide some very detailed instructions on how to download the data.

These information are very technical in nature, such as which method (for example, an \textit{HTTP GET} call) or parameters need to be used to download a specific datum, as well as which operations must be applied to transforming the downloaded data properly.

These information are then passed on to the developers, who write the actual implementation.
