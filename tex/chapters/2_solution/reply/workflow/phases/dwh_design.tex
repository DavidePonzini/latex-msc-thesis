The ETL process needs to load the transformed data on the Data Warehouse.

Its design is done in parallel, by a different team, with the ETL process.
The design process is responsible for the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creating some tables onto which the ETL process will load the data \textit{as-is}.
    
    \item Creating a procedure for performing some operations on the data, such as remapping or adding constants.
    
    \item Loading the data onto the actual end-user tables, as well as checking if the data actually needs to be loaded.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some values may already be present if the ETL process for a given time range is executed multiple times, for example due to errors.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
