The last step is to deploy the whole structure to the production environment.

The deployment is done by exporting all the scripts used (for both the ETL process and the Data Warehouse configuration) and re-importing them into the new environment.
All scripts are then executed, in order to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize (or modify, if they already exist) all tables and procedures in the Data Warehouse.
    
    \item Download the first set of data (typically up to a few years before).
\end{enumerate}

This phase is the most delicate, since this environment is used for production, so it is imperative that the deployment must not cause any errors.

Particular attention must also be paid to the update of existing structures.
For example, if a table structure has to be changed, it is not possible to simply drop and recreate it, since all data would be lost.
It is then necessary to compute the difference between the two versions, and to update as needed.
