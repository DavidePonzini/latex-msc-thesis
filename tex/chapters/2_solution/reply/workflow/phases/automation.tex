Each website provides new data at regular intervals.
It is thus necessary to execute the ETL process each time the provider has new data.

During the functional analysis, each provider has been marked with its update frequency.
This process schedules, for each flow, when the ETL process will be executed, ranging from once a month to multiple times a day.

Since it is necessary to download multiple data streams from each provider, Reply decided to schedule a single job per provider which executes all jobs required for that provider.

A secondary function of the scheduling process is to pause the whole Data Warehouse at night, since it is not going to be used, to reduce cloud maintenance costs.
