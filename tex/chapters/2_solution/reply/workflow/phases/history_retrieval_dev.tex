The ETL procedure downloads data for a single day\footnote{
    To be more precise, the process downloads data for a single time unit, i.e,. the scheduled download interval for a given stream.
    Most streams are downloaded daily, but some have a different download frequency (varying from hourly to two or three times a day).
} but, during the Data Warehouse initialization, it is necessary to download data up to a few years before.

This process creates a wrapper for the ETL procedure, calling it several times, each time downloading data for a different day.
The procedure is iterative, meaning that a single day will be extracted, transformed and loaded before processing the next day.

Days are downloaded backwards.
This allows to handle errors, such as file structure changes, more efficiently, since they will not affect any file downloaded up to that point.
