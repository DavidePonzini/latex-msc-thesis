\label{section:etl}
In this chapter we will describe the process used for extracting, transforming and loading data into the Data Warehouse.

I analyzed the multiple problems encountered during the ETL development as well as the process employed by Reply.
Most problems were however solved by Axpo specialists, since their specific knowledge was required.

I also asked Reply to keep track of all the issues encountered as well as their status.

This can be used both by Reply, to better organize its work, and by Axpo, to understand if a delay is due to an unexpected issue and how well Reply is performing.

The resulting document can be used both as a small layer of documentation and to produce some tests for the more vulnerable parts of the ETL processes.

    In this section we will list a few examples to give a more hands-on idea of some of the problems encountered during development.
