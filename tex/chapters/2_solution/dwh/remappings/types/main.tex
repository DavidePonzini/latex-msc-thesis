In this section, I will provide a few examples of the remappings created by Reply, to give a more hands-on idea of the notations used by different providers, as well as how they have been normalized.
    
Since I was constantly analyzing the Data Warehouse, I often noticed several small problems with remappings, such as wrong associations or missing values.
Each time I noticed a problem, I analyzed the cause and told Reply how to fix the issue.

In other cases, I directly asked Reply to remap additional data, which could be used to improve query performance or to simplify existing queries.
