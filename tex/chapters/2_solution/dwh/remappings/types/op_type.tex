Some providers use different notations when referring to bidding operations type.

Market bids can refer either to purchases of sales.
Each provider represents this information in its own format.

As such, it is necessary to create a remapping table to normalize this notation.
The table needs to know both the original format as well as the provider, since different providers may use the same value for different things.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \toprule
        Provider    & Original  & Remapped  \\
        \midrule
        Provider\_A & P         & Purchase  \\
        Provider\_A & S         & Sell      \\
        Provider\_B & Purchase  & Purchase  \\
        Provider\_B & Sell      & Sell      \\
        Provider\_C & BID       & Purchase  \\
        Provider\_C & OFF       & Sell      \\
        Provider\_D & C         & Purchase  \\
        Provider\_D & V         & Sell      \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Bidding operation type remappings.}
    \label{tab:dwh:remapping:op_type}
\end{table}

The resulting table is similar to table \ref{tab:dwh:remapping:op_type}.

The table hasn't been materialized given its very small size (less than 10 elements).
