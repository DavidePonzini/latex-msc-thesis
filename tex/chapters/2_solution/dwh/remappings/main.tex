Some information can be expressed in different ways.

For example, the same hour can have different values depending on the timezone used.
Some providers also count hours from 0 to 23, while others use the most common 1-24 notation.

When dealing with this kind of data, it is important to choose a consistent and uniform way of these information.

This action is done through additional tables, used to remap the original data to the uniform notation used.
