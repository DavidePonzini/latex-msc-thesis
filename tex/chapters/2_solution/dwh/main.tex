The data warehouse has been built with a particular structure, suited for both storing and processing the huge amount of data needed, as well as dealing efficiently with its high heterogeneity.

The various schemas created, as well as how they contribute to processing and exposing all the information, will be described in this chapter.
A final section will elaborate on a particular type of tables, which plays a very important role in the Data Warehouse.
