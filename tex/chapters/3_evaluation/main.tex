\part{Experimental Evaluation}
    \chapter*{Overview}
        Several different tests have been executed to assess the quality of the migration.
        
        I decided to focus on two main aspects:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Data Quality
            \item Performance
        \end{itemize}
        
        \textbf{Data quality} is the most important requirement asked by Axpo: the accuracy of their business choices is strictly dependant on the quality of the data they are working with.
        
        \textbf{Performance} is also a very important factors, since several critical business processes need to access data in short amounts of time.\newline
        
        This part will describe how each test has been carried out, as well as the results obtained.\\
        Some problems encountered when assessing data quality or performances will also be discussed, as well as their impact on the testing phase.
