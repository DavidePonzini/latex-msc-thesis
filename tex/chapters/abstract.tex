\chapterNoNum{Abstract}
    Migrating the analytical back-end of a company from on-premise to the Cloud can be a very complex task.
    It is important not only to choose an appropriate \textbf{software architecture}, but also to pay attention to the \textbf{organization} of the development process.
    
    A proper \textbf{Data Warehouse structure} must also be chosen to allow efficient storage and retrieval of information.
    The back-end also needs to keep its data constantly updated, so \textbf{custom downloaders} need to be developed.
    These downloaders, using a wide array of different techniques, retrieve information from a large number of data providers with various frequencies.
    
    This thesis contributes to the migration on the Cloud of the Data Warehouse of an energy market company.
    
    In addition, to assess the quality of the migration, two kinds of tests have been performed.
    \textbf{Data quality tests} determine the reliability of the custom downloaders developed, while \textbf{performance tests} estimate the improvements offered by the new back-end.
    
    Multiple \textbf{issues} specific to the energy market domain, which heavily influenced the whole development process, are analyzed in this document.
