This project has been developed at the Italian head quarters of \textbf{Axpo Italia SpA}, located in Genoa.

Axpo Italia SpA is the Italian subsidiary of Axpo Group, providing energy products and solutions to the Italian market \cite{bib:axpo:portrait:it}.
Axpo Group has its headquarters in Switzerland, being the largest producer of renewable energies and one of the leading energy traders worldwide \cite{bib:axpo:portrait:ch}.

Axpo needs to store a large amount of heterogeneous data coming from several different sources, as well as to be able to access these information to perform a wide range of operations, ranging from Business Intelligence analyses to retrieving specific sets of data to execute different algorithms.

The needs of different company departments constitute a complex scenario, composed of a large number of tools and processes, as well as a very complex interaction network between these tools and existing databases.

Axpo has hired \textbf{Power Reply}, a company that specialises in consulting services and development for the Energy and Utilities departments, for the task of migrating the Data Warehouse from on-premise databases to the cloud.

I have worked closely with both Axpo employees and the Reply team assigned to the migration process.
