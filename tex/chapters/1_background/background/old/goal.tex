The goal of the project is to create a single Data Warehouse containing information from several sources, called \textit{providers} (see chapter \ref{section:providers} for details).

This Data Warehouse will provide data to several algorithms, ranging from stock market prediction, for the trading department, to energy production unbalance\footnote{Energy production unbalance is the difference between the energy amount declared in advance and the amount actually generated. Each time the production is less than what declared, the company has to pay a fine.}, for the big data department.
