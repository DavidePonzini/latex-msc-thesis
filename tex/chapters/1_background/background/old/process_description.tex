The task of developing this Data Warehouse has been given to \textbf{Power Reply}, a company that specialises in consulting services and development for the Energy and Utilities departments.

Reply divided the project into several \textit{\textbf{sprints}}, each one focused on downloading, processing and storing on the Data Warehouse a certain number of \textit{streams}. \\
A stream is a specific kind of data offered by a provider (e.g. energy production of a specific power plant).

The content of each sprint has been decided based on how relevant the data is for the trading team.

For a more detailed description of how Reply organized its work, see chapter \ref{section:sprints}.

During development we also encountered some unforeseen problems, which forced us to re-arrange the planning. These problems will be described in detail in chapter \ref{section:issues}.
