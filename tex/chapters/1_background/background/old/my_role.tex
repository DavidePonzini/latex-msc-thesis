My role in this project was to supervise the development of the Data Warehouse, making sure that the resulting structure would suit the needs of the trading department.

Activities such as downloading, cleaning and loading the data into the Data Warehouse were done exclusively by Reply, given their very technical nature.
Nonetheless, I needed to analyze their code to understand if the process was done correctly.

On the other hand, I had a more central role in designing the Data Warehouse itself and deciding which streams to download and store.

In the first case, I had to compare the needs of the trading and big data departments (i.e. which data they needed and in which format) with the design proposed by Reply (which was based only on the data they downloaded).
In several cases these two structures differed and we had to find a solution.

In the second case, I had to understand what were the sources of the data used by the algorithms and check if there were any issues in the planning.
For example, a specific query required some data from a provider which had initially not been accounted for.
I also needed to make sure that the data downloaded was actually correct, and so suitable for being used by the algorithms.
