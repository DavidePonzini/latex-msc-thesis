PolyBase is a tool which allows the SQL Data Warehouse to process SQL queries on data from external sources \cite{bib:azure:polybase}.

The most common external source is Azure Blob Storage.
PolyBase is able to create a connection layer between the Data Warehouse and Blob files.
These files appear to the user as normal external tables.
These files can then be directly queried through SQL.

PolyBase is natively available on Microsoft Azure, so there's no need to perform a manual installation.
The tool is also often transparent to the users, so most times it is actually used without even realizing it.

PolyBase relies on Hadoop to perform cross-source SQL operations.

\paragraph{Advantages}
    Without PolyBase, querying a SQL Data Warehouse along with an external source would require either transferring half of the data available, bringing all data in a single format, or performing two separate queries and writing custom client-side logic to join the data obtained.
    
    With PolyBase this problem is removed, since users can directly query both sources at once using SQL, without having to transfer anything beforehand.

\paragraph{Performance}
    PolyBase can push computation to Hadoop to improve performance.
    The decision is handled by PolyBase's own query optimizer, which uses statistics on external tables to make the cost-based decision.
    Computations on Hadoop create MapReduce jobs which leverage distributed computational resources.
