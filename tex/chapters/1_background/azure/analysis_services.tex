Azure Analysis Services allows users to combine and analyze data from multiple sources.

Users can apply operations or filters on data sources, as well as display the results in multiple graphical formats, such as maps, charts or reports.

This service has not been used during development, but will be used once the entire migration process will be completed to perform Business Intelligence analysis on the data contained in the data warehouse.
