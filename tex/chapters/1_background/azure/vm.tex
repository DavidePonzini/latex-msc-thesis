A virtual machine can be run on the Azure cloud services.

The machines can be customized depending on the user needs, with options ranging from the operating system to vCPUs\footnote{
    \textit{Virtual CPU}.
    A vCPU is a share of a physical CPU that is assigned to a virtual machine.
    It is possible to assign multiple \textit{vCPUs} to a single Azure Virtual Machine.
} and RAM available.

The chosen virtual machine runs Windows Server, with a graphical environment installed.

Users can install their own applications on the machine, running code in languages or environments not supported by Azure Databricks.
