We define as \textit{environment} a \texttt{resource group}, i.e. a collection of resources that can be managed together.

We created two environments in order to answer to the different needs of the project.
These environment are used respectively for development and production.

All environments have the same tools and configuration, the only difference is how they are used.

\paragraph{Development}
    The development environment, nicknamed \textit{Toycase}, is where Reply develops new functionalities.
    
    This environment may contain work-in-progress scripts, along with some tests on functionalities or data.
    Moreover, the data warehouse contains only a portion of the data needed by the algorithms, since the purpose of this environment is to test whether the downloader works.
    
\paragraph{Production}
    The production environment is architecturally identical to the development environment, but it is actively used by end-users and their algorithms.
    
    This environment contains up to several years of data history for each provider and constantly downloads new information when scheduled.
    
    All the code on this environment must always work without errors.
    To guarantee this, all the code has to be previously tested on the development environment.
