Azure Automation Account allows user to schedule management operations for the whole environment.

Users can create \textit{Runbooks}, which are a set of scheduled commands, and execute them.

Runbooks can be created either through a graphical interface or by using Python or Powershell.

A single runbook can contain multiple jobs, each one performing a single task.
Each job can be scheduled to be executed at a specific time.
