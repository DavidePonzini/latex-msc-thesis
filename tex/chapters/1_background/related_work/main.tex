A large number of migration processes have already been carried out in different scenarios outside of the company.

The migration process discussed in this document presents, however, three main peculiarities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A huge amount of data required to migrate.
    \item The need to create custom extractors to download new data every day.
    \item A high downloading complexity.
\end{itemize}

This chapter discusses the state-of-the-art techniques used to perform migration processes, as well as various problems related to cloud migrations.
A final part will focus on different testing approaches for making sure the information stored on the cloud are identical to those already present on-premise.
