Moving workloads and data to the Cloud is becoming a reality for a very large number of companies.

According to a survey carried out in 2018 by \textit{Druva}, a cloud data management and security company, 90\% of the 170 companies interviewed have either already moved to the Cloud or intend to do so in the near future \cite{bib:related_work:migration:moving_to_cloud}.

The main drivers of these migrations are disaster recovery, ease of management, and archival.

Data in the Cloud is stored in multiple places around the world, meaning that in case of disasters no data will be lost, thanks to redundancy protocols.
The architecture itself, on the other hand, is directly managed by the Cloud provider, meaning that companies will have one less problem to worry about.

There are also other factors which make Cloud migrations more appealing, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic scalability.
    \item Reliability.
    \item High availability.
    \item Remote access.
    \item Easier cost forecasting.
\end{itemize}
